Overview of the Project
Project: Simple Calculator in Python
This project is a basic Python calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to be user-friendly, providing an easy interface for users to perform calculations.

Features
The Python calculator includes the following features:

Addition: Adds two numbers together.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Calculator
Step 1: Running the Calculator
To run the calculator, execute the calculator.py file in your Python environment.

bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Step 2: Inputting Numbers
The calculator prompts the user to input two numbers. The user should enter numeric values when prompted.
Step 3: Selecting an Operation
The calculator provides the following operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
The user should select an operation by entering the corresponding number.

Step 4: Viewing the Result
After selecting the operation, the calculator will perform the calculation and display the result.
If the user selects division, the program checks for division by zero and returns a message if this occurs.
Example Usage
Here is an example of how the calculator works:

markdown
Copy code
Simple Calculator
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Select operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
The result is: 15.0
Code Overview
Functions
add(x, y)

Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y)

Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y)

Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y)

Returns the quotient of x divided by y. If y is zero, it returns a message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.
Main Function: calculator()
The calculator() function is the main entry point of the program. It handles user input, displays operation options, and calls the appropriate arithmetic function based on user selection.
Conclusion
This simple Python calculator project provides a fundamental understanding of how to create and implement basic arithmetic operations in Python. It also introduces error handling for scenarios like division by zero, making the calculator more robust and user-friendly.
